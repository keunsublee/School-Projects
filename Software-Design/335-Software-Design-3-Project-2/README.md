Input texts contains a series of strings that are either 'insert (positive int)' or 'pop median'.  
Parse the strings to create a vector of positive integers for 'insert (positive int)' and -1 for 'pop median'.  
Use this vector as input to sort them in containers: vector, list, heap, and an AVL tree.  
Each median function will execute insert and pop median operations according to the parsed vector.  
Time the sorting and popping of medians for each container (and sort/rebalance for every insert and pop operation).  
Print the elapsed time and popped medians for each container using their median functions.  
Currently only prints the sorting time, function for printing popped median vector is commented. 

Input texts contain 400, 4000, 16000, 64000 strings.  
Main executable included.
